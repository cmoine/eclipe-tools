/**
 * Like a LiveExpression but has an option to ensures that its refresh
 * method is always called in a background job.
 * <p>
 * With a regular LiveExp the refresh will be called on the same thread
 * as the change event it reacts to. So in general you have little control
 * over what thread that might be.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, listeners will be called on the same thread as well.
 * <p>
 * An {@link AsyncLiveExpression} provides the option to make either refresh or change notification
 * asynchronous; or both.
 * <p>
 * Making refresh asynchronuus is useful when the 'compute' method called during refresh
 * does something that you might not want to just execute, for example, on the UI thread and
 * you want to ensures it is done in a background job.
 * <p>
 * It is also useful in that when refreshes might be 'lengthy' operations, bursty events
 * triggering refreshes will only causes limited refreshes as only a single Job is
 * being scheduled and rescheduled.
 * <p>
 * Asynchronous change notification is useful when you want to make sure listeners respond to
 * changes in a separate thread. For example, because, you make changes to an underlying model
 * inside a synchronized block and want to avoid implicitly passing ownership of the lock to
 * the listeners.
 * <p>
 * Though it is possible to select both asyncRefresh and asyncEvents mode at the same time.
 * It is probably not ever necessary or logical to that since when refresh is async it
 * means that change notification alreayd gets triggered in an asynchronous manner (i.e. in
 * the same job that performs the refresh.
 * <p>
 * Selecting bot asynch modes at the same time thus essentially just adds unnessary overhead
 * by creating an addional job to perform change notification.
